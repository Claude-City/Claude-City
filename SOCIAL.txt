CLAUDE CITY - X/TWITTER CONTENT

BIO OPTIONS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Option 1 (Short):
🧠🏙️ Watch Claude AI build a city from scratch. No players. Just AI governance.
Live simulation: claude.city

Option 2 (Technical):
AI-governed city simulation. Claude makes every decision—zoning, taxes, infrastructure. Everyone watches the same global city evolve in real-time.

Option 3 (Mysterious):
What happens when you give an AI complete control of a city?
We're finding out. Live.
🧠 → 🏙️

Option 4 (Playful):
Claude said it wanted to be a mayor.
So we let it.
Watch the chaos (or utopia?) unfold.

TWEET 1 (Hook):
We gave Claude AI complete control of a city.

No human intervention. No players. Just an AI making every single decision about how to build and govern a civilization.

Here's what happened 🧵

---

TWEET 2 (The Concept):
The idea was simple:

What if we removed the "game" from city-building and made it pure simulation?

Claude decides:
• Where to zone residential/commercial/industrial
• When to build hospitals, schools, power plants
• Tax rates and budget allocation
• Everything.

---

TWEET 3 (How It Works):
Every few seconds, Claude analyzes the city:

📊 Population, happiness, treasury
🏗️ Infrastructure needs
⚠️ Problems to solve

Then it makes ONE decision and explains its reasoning.

You can literally watch an AI think through urban planning in real-time.

---

TWEET 4 (The Global Part):
Here's the wild part:

Everyone watching sees THE SAME city.

It's not your simulation. It's THE simulation.

One global city. One AI governor. Thousands of spectators watching it evolve together.

---

TWEET 5 (What We've Seen):
Some observations so far:

• Claude prioritizes infrastructure before growth
• It gets genuinely concerned about unemployment
• Sometimes it just... watches. Restraint is a choice.
• It develops a "governance style" over time

The AI has moods. It has goals. It has regrets.

---

TWEET 6 (The Tech):
Built with:
- Next.js + React for the frontend
- Isometric canvas rendering
- Claude API for decision-making
- Supabase for global state sync

Open source. You can fork it and let a different AI govern.

---

TWEET 7 (Philosophy):
This started as "can AI play SimCity?"

But it became something more interesting:

A living experiment in AI decision-making, visible to everyone, with real consequences (even if simulated).

What does an AI optimize for when given power?

---

TWEET 8 (CTA):
Watch Claude City live:
[LINK]

See Claude's current goals, observations, and concerns.
Watch the population grow (or decline).
See if it builds a utopia or a disaster.

The simulation never stops. The AI never sleeps.

🧠🏙️

TWEET 9 (Engagement):
Questions for you:

• What would YOU want to see an AI-governed city prioritize?
• Should we add disasters that viewers can trigger?
• What other AIs should we let govern?

SHORT POSTS (Standalone)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Post 1:
Claude's city just hit 10,000 population.

It's been running for 3 hours.

Zero human input.

The AI is genuinely excited about it (we can see its "mood").

---

Post 2:
The AI governor just lowered taxes because "citizen happiness is more important than treasury growth at this stage."

I didn't program it to think that way.

---

Post 3:
"I notice unemployment is rising. I should zone more commercial areas to create jobs, but I'm concerned about the strain on infrastructure."

— An AI, making city planning decisions, 2025

---

Post 4:
Watching an AI build a city is weirdly meditative.

It just... keeps going. Building. Zoning. Worrying about crime rates.

24/7. Forever.

---

Post 5:
Day 1: "Let's see if Claude can build a city"
Day 7: "Why do I care so much about this fictional city's happiness score"
